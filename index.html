  <h2>Surface reflectivity in polar regions retrieved from TDS-1 mission</h2>
  <p>
  This page is created as additional information for the <a href="https://www.egu21.eu/">EGU 2021</a>. 
      See <a href="https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU21/EGU21-13036.html">here</a> for program description.
  In current times of a changing global climate, a special interest is focused on the large-scale recording of sea ice. 
  Bi-statically reflected signals of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) could play an important role in fulfilling the task. 
  Within this project, sensitivity of spacebourne GNSS-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) to sea ice properties is evaluated.

<h2>Sea Ice Thickness</h2>
<p>
  There are different variables useful for scientists. 
  While Extent shows the covered area, the Concentration shows area of sea ice relative to the total at a given point in the ocean. 
  We want to focus today on the Sea ice Thickness (SIT). 
  It is measures as the depth between the ice-sea interface and the layer of snow on top.

<h2>TechDemoSat-1</h2>
<p>
  The here used satellite TechDemoSat-1, built by the british company SSTL, was launched in 2014. 
  It’s payload contains multiple GNSS receiver antennas: 
   It includes a down-looking antenna for the reflected as well as an up-looking antenna dedicated to receive the direct signal. 
  The raw data, provided by the manufacturer SSTL, were pre-processed by <a href="https://www.ice.csic.es/en/">IEEC/ICE-CSIC</a> to derive georeferenced signal power values.

<h2>Reflectivity</h2>  
<p>
  The amount of signal being reflected depends for GPS and smooth surfaces on the angle of reflection and the dielectric property of the surface. 
  The relative permittivity as dielectric property of a material depends on the internal components of the medium and their distribution.  
  When getting older, sea ice tends go get thicker. 
  Because of decreasing salinity, i.e. less permittivity, as well as relatively higher surface roughness of older ice, it can be assumed that reflected signal strength decreases with increasing SIT.
  That is why sea ice for microwave use cases is classified into, for example, new sea ice, First-Year Sea Ice and so on. </p>

<p>The reflection data used were recorded in the years 2015 and 2016 by the TDS-1 satellite over the Arctic and Antarctic.
  From TDS-1 data, reflectivity over smooth surfaces is calculated as the ratio of reflected and direct signal power.</p>
<p>R = p_r/p_d</p>
<h2>Correction</h2>  
<p>The signal has to be corrected for Free-Space Path loss (FSPL) and antenna gain</p>
<p>
  The gain pattern describes the directivity of the antenna. 
  These patterns are determined by laboratory measurements provided by the manufacturers as a function of elevation and azimuth. 
  Especially the nadir antenna gain is characterized by high gains in boresight and inhomogeneous pattern.
</p>

<p>
  The Free-Space Path loss (FSPL) depends on carrier frequency of the signal, GPS L1 (1575.42 MHz), and the distance between transmitter and receiver. 
  The distance of the reflected path between GPS satellite and TDS-1 has been calculated by using a model of earth’s surface as the well known positions of both satellites.
  Differences of nadir and zenith antenna FSPL and gain show influence of up to 6 dB and −9 dB to 9 dB respectively on the recorded signal strength.
  The grayed out area in the following plot represents the values later filtered because of the angle filter I mentioned before.

<p>
  After calculation, we can now eliminate the receiver antenna gain and the Free-Space Path loss for each direct and reflected signal.

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
  All retrieved reflectivity values are compared to model predictions based on Fresnel coefficients but also to available ancillary truth data
  For SIT we use <a href="https://icdc.cen.uni-hamburg.de/en/l3c-smos-sit.html">SMOS Sea Ice Thickness Information by University Hamburg</a>. 
    On the map below, SMOS is represented by the blue and white raster data, the red and white dots show the reflectivity. 
    SMOS SIT estimation indicates promising sensitivity for PRN 15 over Hudson Bay. 
    For thinner sea ice, the reflectivity shows expected higher values. 
    The thicker the ice, the less it reflects, which can be seen in the darker red points on the map and also on the correlation plot on the right side.

    <p>
    PRN 13 will be filtered out because of high nadir angle at receiver antenna, but is plotted also for comparison and you can sense the fluctuating values of gain uncertainties.
  </p>
  <h2>Discussion of further error terms</h2>
  <p>
    There are further unmodelled error terms. 
    One of them is the inaccuracy in the calculation of the gain resulting from the uncertainty in the attitude determination of the satellite. 
    By excluding the high nadir angles this danger could be limited. 
    In future, however, it would be desirable to use these angle ranges too.  
    The atmospheric loss is very small, maximum 0.38 decibel at low elevation angles and can actually be neglected. 
    In the future, the signal loss due to the ionosphere can be included into the correction too. 
    What also remains to be a problem is the contribution of rough scattering.
    It is expected to be low over sea ice, but still could lead to lower reflectivity then expected.</p>
  <h2>Further work</h2>
  <p>A master thesis is currently (April 2021) in progress. There, also Doppler analysis and possible retracking of the signal delay is considered.</p>
