<p>There are different variables useful for scientists. While Extent shows the covered area, the Concentration shows area of sea ice relative to the total at a given point in the ocean. We want to focus today on the Sea ice Thickness. It is the depth between the ice-sea interface and the layer of snow on top.</p>

<p>The here used satellite TechDemoSat-1, built by the british company SSTL, was launched in 2014. It’s payload contains multiple GNSS receiver antennas: The nadir antenna is seen on the image with the twirling elements. It is characterized by a high gain and also the left-handed circular polarization, which we usually can expect from our reflected GPS signal at high angles. The direct signal, denoted on the right figure with dd, is received by a single patch antenna on the zenith side. It’s right-handed circular polarization corresponds to the polarization of the direct GPS signal. On the right figure you can also see the two angles important for this presentation: The nadir angle Beta of the antenna and the elevation angle Alpha of the specular point.</p>
