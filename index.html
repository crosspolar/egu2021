<h2>Sea Ice Thickness</h2>
<p>There are different variables useful for scientists. While Extent shows the covered area, the Concentration shows area of sea ice relative to the total at a given point in the ocean. We want to focus today on the Sea ice Thickness. It is the depth between the ice-sea interface and the layer of snow on top.</p>

<h2>TechDemoSat-1</h2>
<p>The here used satellite TechDemoSat-1, built by the british company SSTL, was launched in 2014. It’s payload contains multiple GNSS receiver antennas: The nadir antenna is seen on the image with the twirling elements. It is characterized by a high gain and also the left-handed circular polarization, which we usually can expect from our reflected GPS signal at high angles. The direct signal, denoted on the right figure with dd, is received by a single patch antenna on the zenith side. It’s right-handed circular polarization corresponds to the polarization of the direct GPS signal. On the right figure you can also see the two angles important for this presentation: The nadir angle Beta of the antenna and the elevation angle Alpha of the specular point.</p>

<h2>Reflectivity</h2>  
<p>So, how much signal power is expected to be reflected? This depends for GPS and smooth surfaces on the angle of reflection and the dielectric property of the surface. The relative permittivity as dielectric property of a material depends on the internal components of the medium and their distribution.  These properties change with the age of the sea ice, which is why sea ice can be classified as you can see here as  for example new sea ice, First-Year Sea Ice and so on. When the nadir antenna receives left-handed circular polarization as in our case, at larger angles seawater has the highest reflection. The older the sea ice gets, the less it reflects.</p>
<p>So the sea water we expect to reflect a lot due to it‘s high relative permittivity. The older and thicker the ice, the lower the reflectivity is expected.</p>
<p>From TDS-1 data, reflectivity over smooth surfaces is calculated as the ratio of reflected and direct signal power.</p>
<h2>Correction</h2>  
<p>For correction, antenna gain and path loss have to be calculated.</p>
<p>The gain pattern describes the directivity of the antenna. That is, where the signal is amplified and where it is attenuated. These patterns are determined by laboratory measurements provided by the manufacturers. Especially the nadir antenna gain is characterized by high gains in boresight and inhomogeneous pattern.</p>

<p>The Free-Space Path loss depends on carrier frequency of the signal and the distance between transmitter and receiver. The distance between GPS satellite and TDS-1 has been calculated by using a model of earth’s surface as the well known positions of both satellites.</p>

<p>After calculation, we can now subtract the receiver antenna gain and the Free-Space Path loss for each direct and reflected signal. I grayed out the area, which will be dropped later anyway because of the angle filter I mentioned before.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
  <p>The final results should get checked for their reliability, so we also use SMOS Sea Ice Thickness Information by University Hamburg. On the map on the left SMOS is represented by the blue and white raster data, the red and white dots show the reflectivity. The right figure is the correlation plot. Even though real in-situ Ground Truth Data seems not available, SMOS ice thickness estimation indicates promising results for PRN 15 over Hudson Bay. For thinner sea ice, the reflectivity shows expected higher values. The thicker the ice, the less it reflects, which can be seen in the darker red points on the map and also on the correlation plot on the right side.</p>
  <p>PRN 13 was originally filtered out because of high nadir angle at receiver antenna, but is plotted also for comparison and you can sense the fluctuating values of gain uncertainties.</p>

  <h2>Discussion of further error terms</h2>
  <p>What’s now with the unmodelled error terms? In the equation at the beginning we had listed further unmodelled error terms. One of them is the inaccuracy in the calculation of the gain resulting from the uncertainty in the attitude determination of the satellite. By excluding the high nadir angles this danger could be limited. In future, however, it would be desirable to use these angle ranges too.  The atmospheric loss is very small, maximum 0.38 decibel at low elevation angles and can actually be neglected. In the future, the signal loss due to the ionosphere can be included into the correction too. What also remains to  be a problem is the contribution of rough scattering. It is expected to be low over sea ice, but still could lead to lower reflectivity then expected.</p>
  <h2>Further work</h2>
  <p>A master thesis is currently (April 2021) in progress. There, also Doppler analysis and possible retracking of the signal delay is considered.</p>
