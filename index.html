<h1>Sea Ice Thickness</h1>
<p>There are different variables useful for scientists. While Extent shows the covered area, the Concentration shows area of sea ice relative to the total at a given point in the ocean. We want to focus today on the Sea ice Thickness. It is the depth between the ice-sea interface and the layer of snow on top.</p>

<h1>TechDemoSat-1</h1>
<p>The here used satellite TechDemoSat-1, built by the british company SSTL, was launched in 2014. It’s payload contains multiple GNSS receiver antennas: The nadir antenna is seen on the image with the twirling elements. It is characterized by a high gain and also the left-handed circular polarization, which we usually can expect from our reflected GPS signal at high angles. The direct signal, denoted on the right figure with dd, is received by a single patch antenna on the zenith side. It’s right-handed circular polarization corresponds to the polarization of the direct GPS signal. On the right figure you can also see the two angles important for this presentation: The nadir angle Beta of the antenna and the elevation angle Alpha of the specular point.</p>

<h1>Reflectivity</h1>  
<p>So, how much signal power is expected to be reflected? This depends for GPS and smooth surfaces on the angle of reflection and the dielectric property of the surface. The relative permittivity as dielectric property of a material depends on the internal components of the medium and their distribution.  These properties change with the age of the sea ice, which is why sea ice can be classified as you can see here as  for example new sea ice, First-Year Sea Ice and so on. When the nadir antenna receives left-handed circular polarization as in our case, at larger angles seawater has the highest reflection. The older the sea ice gets, the less it reflects.</p>
<p>So the sea water we expect to reflect a lot due to it‘s high relative permittivity. The older and thicker the ice, the lower the reflectivity is expected.</p>
